# What have I learned?

* CSS:
  * BEM methodology,
  * How to strategically use the ```margin```, ```padding``` and ```position: relative``` rules,
  * How to work with relative units like EM and REM,
  * Variables,
  * Flexbox,
  * Treat the layout as a set of components,
  * Basics of Responsive Web Design,
  * To minimize code seeing patterns and common properties (minus components because they have to be independent of everything) by creating "helper classes" (as if we were dealing with a framework). Examples given on typography or on some positioning such as ```text-align: center```.
* JavaScript:
  * How to give an element an "anchor" behaviour.
* How to use the element inspector of a web browser.
